Monoski is one single ski used for skiing on snow. The skiers both feet are attached to the  monoski parallell close to each other facing forward in the monoski's lengthwise direction. 

The popularity of monoski is compared to usual skies and snowboards quite low. Monoski was introduced in the early 1970s and had it's peak during 1980s just before the snowboard overflowed the market. 
Despite that the monoski often is a given attribute on a nostalgic 80's ski party, the monoski has evolved with the rest of the ski world and features found on modern skies and snowboards like twintip, carving and rockers are common on monoskis manufactured today. 

Especially carving has developed the monoski to be more easy, aggressive and nimble to ski in most conditions. The popularity for monoskiing is increasing in part of the world like France, North America and in the nordic countries. 
Another reason for the increased popularity in monoskiing is the low tension to knees and hips the monoskier feels when skiing. The monoski requires the skiers to keep the knees close and always work together, the twisting motion alpine skies adress to the knees is not a concern for the monoskier and some skiers who has broken knees and not are able to ski on alpine skies can without problem ski on monoski instead.
